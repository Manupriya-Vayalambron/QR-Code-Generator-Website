# QR-Code-Generator-Website
A website to generate QR codes, made with HTML, CSS and JS.
 I completed this short, crisp and effective course on Udemy where I built a QR generator website using HTML, CSS and JS

The course guided me on the usage of Google Chart API, but since it is outdated, I used quickchart.io

The only change was to replace chart.googleapis.com with quickchart.io

Further, it was my first time hosting a website using Blogger. It was a seamless experience where I was able to host my basic website. I would still prefer GitHub though, because here, there was no option for separate HTML, CSS and JS files. They all needed to be integrated into a single one. I also learnt to edit the shortcut icon to my website using <link>

Overall, I got the basic knowledge of javascript along with necessary HTML and CSS knowledge. I am extremely satisfied with the course and would like to thank Narendra Dwivedi sir for his mentorship ü§ù
